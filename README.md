## Code Info
To build this page we usde a variety of web API's, HTML, CSS, and JS. The HTML
was layed out with a web api libary called TailwindCSS to get the look and
wireframe we wanted the page to have. We also used TailwindCSS to layout the
media queries for the page. For the CSS/styling of the page we made a custom 
style sheet to fit how we wanted the page to be colored and look. For the server
side api's used in this web app we used, a restaurant api called Documenu, and a
movie streaming api called Streaming Availability. Then with the JS we have
functions that will call those api's check for errors and if there are no error
it will generate HTML to the page.
